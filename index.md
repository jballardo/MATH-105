## Course Description

This course presents the concepts of precalculus from four points of view: geometric (graphs), numeric (tables), symbolic (formulas), and written (verbal descriptions). The emphasis is on the mathematical modeling of real-life problems using linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. Students develop their reading, writing, and questioning skills in an interactive classroom setting.
